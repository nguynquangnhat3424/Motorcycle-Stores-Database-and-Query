# Motorcycle Stores Database and Query

This project aims to create a database for a motorcycle store using SQL. The database will consist of the following tables:

* **Brands:** This table will store information about the brands that the store sells.
* **Categories:** This table will store information about the categories of products that the store sells.
* **Stocks:** This table will store information about the product inventory.
* **Products:** This table will store information about the products that the store sells.
* **Customers:** This table will store information about the customers of the store.
* **Stores:** This table will store information about the stores that the company owns.
* **Staffs:** This table will store information about the staffs of the store.
* **Orders:** This table will store information about the orders that have been placed by customers.
* **Order Items:** This table will store information about the items that have been ordered by customers.
* **Relatives:** This table will store information about the relatives of staffs.

**Steps:**

* **Create tables:** The tables will be created using SQL statements.
* **Insert data:** Data will be inserted into the tables using SQL statements.
* **Create functions and procedures:** Functions and procedures will be created to perform complex operations on the database.
* **Write sample queries:** Sample queries will be written to retrieve data from the database.
* **Test user permissions:** The functionality of the database will be tested with different user permissions.

**Database Design**

The database will be designed using the following principles:

* **Normalization:** The tables will be normalized to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
* **Referential integrity:** Referential integrity will be enforced between the tables to ensure data consistency.
* **Data types:** The appropriate data types will be used for each column in the tables.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how to create a database for a retail store using SQL. The database will provide a number of benefits, including improved data organization and management, increased data accuracy and consistency, enhanced data access and retrieval, and improved decision-making.
